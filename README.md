# Sparse-Index-Tracking  
  
This is an attempt to solve the Sparse Index tracking problem as an optimization problem; optimize via ADMM.  
For the mathemtical derivation of the ADMM that I've used check [here](https://github.com/kchu25/Sparse-Index-Tracking/blob/main/sparse_index_tracking.pdf).  
The main file is index_tracking.jl.
